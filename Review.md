Advantages:
- Well-orgarnized files and folders.  
Disadvantages & Suggestion:
- The game only has 1 scene, which can cause merge conflicts (in Git or other version control software) in case 2 or more people working on it and making changes at the same time. I suggest seperating the menu and each game mode into their own scenes.
